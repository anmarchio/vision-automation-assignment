# Questions related to assignment

## On Task 1:

Concerning the potential API endpoints:
- is there a general definition? How is the endpoint reachable?
- is authentication necessary? Can I assume a made up endpoint (which is now the case)?

Concerning Serial ID API Calls:
- is the api endpoint defined in any form?
- is the ID callable as e.g. `example.com/serial/<id>`?

## Task 2:
- Which interface should be used for DIO communication (MQTT, OPC UA, GPIO with commercial sdk)?
- can I assume that the DIO communication is a one-way communication, e.g. `0.0.0.0:500`?
- which signal should be sent? A 1 for "on"? Or the numberOfDetectedObjects?

## Task 3:
- Same question as above: is the OPC UA endpoint defined?
- if not, I will define a default endpoint for opc ua testing (e.g. a commercial available service such as sterfive)

## Additional Requirements:
- how far-reaching should the unit testing be?
- there different schools of thought and expectations, therefore I will assume minimal testing for the sake of time
